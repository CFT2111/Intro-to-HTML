# Introduction to HTML

1. Creating a simple web page
    - Open [tbl.html](tbl.html).
    - Copy this text into a text editor
    - Select file>save as and then save the file as *tbl.html*
    - Open this HTML file using a web browser (FireFox or Chrome)
    - *Mark-up* the page by adding some HTML tags for the headings and lists
        - To start with, you need to be familiar with:
            - h1
            - h2
            - p
            - ul
            - ol
            - li
            - em
            - strong
        - You won't know how to use many of these tags. To see examples of the tags being used and to better understand how to use them see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals
    - Test your page in a web browser

2. For further practice, create another webpage. The content for this page should be information about the course you are studying.
    * Visit the University website to find information for your course.
    * Create a new file in your text editor. From Brightspace find the HTML template. You can use this as a starting point for your web pages. Copy the HTML code from the template into your new file and save it as *course.html*.
    * Copy content from the university website and mark up your webpage using the key text-related tags listed above.
