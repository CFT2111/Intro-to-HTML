# Introduction to HTML

1. Creating a simple web page
    - Open [tbl.html](tbl.html).
    - Copy this text into a text editor
    - Select file>save as and then save the file as *tbl.html*
    - Open this HTML file using a web browser (FireFox or Chrome)
    - *Mark-up* the page by adding some HTML tags for the headings and lists
        - To start with, you need to be familiar with:
            - h1
            - h2
            - p
            - ul
            - ol
            - li
            - em
            - strong
        - You won't know how to use many of these tags. To see examples of the tags being used and to better understand how to use them see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals 
    - Test your page in a web browser
    - Validate the page using the W3C validator [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). 
        - Upload the page you have just created to check it is valid HTML 5.   
2. For further practice, create another webpage. The content for this page should be information about the course you are studying. 
    * Visit the University website to find information for your course. 
    * Create a new file in your text editor. From Brightspace find the HTML template. You can use this as a starting point for your web pages. Copy the HTML code from the template into your new file and save it as *course.html*. 
    * Copy and content from this page and mark up your webpage using the key text-related tage listed above.
    * Validate the page using the W3C validator 
3. Try and find some resources that are going to help you learn HTML and CSS.  
    * The reading list for the module is a good starting point. This list contains recommendations for books, websites and video tutorials. 
    * You don't have to use the resources on the reading list. There are lots of good HTML and CSS resources out there, so find something that works for you. The advice I would offer is:
        * Make sure it is recent (no earlier that 2013)
        * Make sure it focuses on HTML and CSS. Lots of HTML 5 books cover JavaScript, avoid these.  
        * You shouldn't have to pay for resources. The library has physical books, electronic books and subscribes to high quality video learning materials.   You can use the library search engine https://library.hud.ac.uk/ to explore the HTML and CSS resources that are available.
